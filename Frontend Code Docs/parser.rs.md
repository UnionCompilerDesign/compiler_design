### Abstract

A parser is a component in compilers and interpreters that takes tokens generated by a lexer and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from them. The parser analyzes the token sequence according to the rules of the language's grammar, building a tree structure that represents the hierarchical syntactic structure of the input code.
